# ihme_covproj_test
Plots IHME's COVID-19 deaths projections for different locations and dates vs actuals, to see how well they did.

```
Usage: python draw_proj_vs_time.py (-s) [location]
  -s : save an animated gif instead of running interactively
Note: if the location name has a space, enclose the name in quotes.
Example: python draw_proj_vs_time.py "New York"
```

Requirements:
* linux-like terminal environment (works on my Mac)
* python3 with numpy and matplotlib
* imagemagick

Example output gif:
